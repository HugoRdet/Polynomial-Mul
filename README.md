# Polynomial Multiplication Algorithms Comparison

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and comparison of various algorithms for polynomial multiplication over prime fields, specifically focusing on the Naive, Karatsuba, and Toom-Cook algorithms. The aim is to evaluate their efficiency and identify optimal use cases based on polynomial degree.

## Algorithms
- **Naive Algorithm**: Implements the straightforward approach to polynomial multiplication.
- **Karatsuba Algorithm**: A divide and conquer algorithm that improves on the naive approach.
- **Toom-Cook Algorithm**: A further generalization of the Karatsuba approach, splitting the problem into more parts.

## Implementation Notes

All algorithms are implemented in C with careful attention to memory management to ensure there are no memory leaks.
